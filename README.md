To us the theme in the app. You just clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/Angus-Paillaugue/YT-Music-Nord-Theme`), move the `theme.css` file wherever you want to store it (I put it in the app config directory : `/.config/YouTube Music`). Then import the theme via `Options -> Visual Tweaks -> Theme -> Import custom CSS file` :
